## Facial Recognition system for student authentication at NYU

# 
Value proposition: 
A facial recognition system will be used for authentication for exams/tests at NYU. This will act as a 2 factor authentication along with the userâ€™s ID card, ensuring that there is no cheating during the exam.

Status Quo: Currently no attendance system or official system exists for verifying student identities. If any class did decide to take attendance manually, it would be hard to verify and take a lot of time

Business metrics:
Security - Unauthorized students will not be able to enter the testing area.
Efficiency - Manual attendance and student verification is time consuming and will take unnecessary manpower
Scalability - This verification will scale well for Online exams, where faces can be checked at one time, if needed to explore in the future

## System diagram

#Overall digram of system. Doesn't need polish, does need to show all the pieces. 
Must include: all the hardware, all the containers/software platforms, all the models, 
all the data. -->

|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 'compute_skylake' | 2 for entire project                   | 1 in model serving and 1 for model evaluation and load testing           |

| Floating IPs    | 2 running perpetually |               |    1 for model serving api, 1 for monitoring while training, testing and serving
| Persistent Volume  - 'block storage'   |                1 volume - 10GB                                  |       Needed to store model checkpoints, logs, retrained models, and OpenVINO outputs        |
| Object Storage 'CHI@TACC Swift' |   1 volume - 50GB     |  Storing the static dataset

## Detailed design plan

#In each section, you should describe (1) your strategy, (2) the relevant parts of the 
diagram, (3) justification for your strategy, (4) relate back to lecture material, 
(5) include specific numbers. -->

### Model training and training platforms

#Make sure to clarify how you will satisfy the Unit 4 and Unit 5 requirements, 
and which optional "difficulty" points you are attempting. -->

### Model serving and monitoring platforms

#Make sure to clarify how you will satisfy the Unit 6 and Unit 7 requirements, 
and which optional "difficulty" points you are attempting. -->

### Data pipeline

#Make sure to clarify how you will satisfy the Unit 8 requirements,  and which 
optional "difficulty" points you are attempting. -->

### Continuous X

Infrastructure-as-Code:
- All infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform for resources, IPs and volumes on Chameleon Cloud.
- Ansible Playbooks are used to configure and deploy:
  - Triton Inference Server
  - MLflow
  - Prometheus
  - API services (FastAPI)

Cloud-Native Architecture:
- Immutable Infrastructure:
  - Infrastructure changes are made via pull requests to Git, then re-provisioned.
- Microservices:
  - The system is split into containers: API Server, Inference, Monitoring, Training, Testing, Storage
  - Each container communicates via APIs
- Containerization:
  - All services are Dockerized and deployed with Kubernetes.
  - Model training and inference environments are decoupled and reproducible.

CI/CD and Continuous Training Pipeline:
- ArgoCD power our CI/CD and retraining pipelines:
  - Triggered on schedule (ideally per semester to include new students).

Staged Deployment:
- Services will be promoted from one environment to another using AgroCD.
- Staging:
  - Load-tested with student entries.
- Canary:
  - Small percentage of live exam verifications pass through new model.
  - Metrics monitored via Prometheus.
- Production:
  - Model promoted if no degradation is observed during canary phase.
